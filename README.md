An app where users can manage their books and authors

[View App](https://jg-simply-books.netlify.app/)

## About the User <!-- This is a scaled down user persona -->
- The ideal user for this application is someone who needs to keep track of the books they read, the authors of those books, and their favorite authors.
- This app allows the user to view and manipulate their personal, invdividualized author and books data.

## Features <!-- List your app features using bullets! Do NOT use a paragraph. No one will read that! -->
- User can add a new book or author, including their respective details.
- User can edit and update books and authors, changing any of their details.
- User can delete their books and authors, as well as items in their cart.
- Users can make their books public upon creation, meaning anyone can see the books without having to log in.
- User can add books to their cart, where they will display with a total price, and user can "check out" (for now, just clear their cart, simluating a real transaction.)
